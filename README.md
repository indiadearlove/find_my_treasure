# Find my treasure

### Things I would have liked to give more time to
- Error handling such as:
  - checking if summary given to `find_treasure_with_pirate_summary` is valid
  - error handling for if the nth value given to `nth_trench_deepest_points` is more than the amount of trenches
- Tests such as:
  - `max_depth_location` returns multiple locations if multiple of same depth
  - checking the examples given for trenches are true for `is_trench` and false for the ones that are not
- Would probably think more about the names given to functions and variables
- There were a few ways to approach task three, I might have approached it differently if I had more time to plan
